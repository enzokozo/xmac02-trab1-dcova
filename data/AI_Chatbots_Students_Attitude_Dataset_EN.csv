Personally, I only use it when I'm not entirely sure about a question and want to see how reliable the information given by the AI is by comparing it to other sources. It's helped me quite a few times, I think it's comprehensive, and I like the option of being able to present one piece of information in several different ways with different words. I'm glad I have this opportunity to use it and I think it would be useful in education for the future, but not professionally because there everyone has to apply what they already know.

It generates different answers, which is a big plus for the development of tasks of different topics. I don't trust the chatbot 100% though and am checking other sources. It would be useful to integrate it into the learning environment, but not to rely on it completely.

Accessibility makes it even easier because you can refer to it at any time. As an improvement, I would add a function to take photos and display images and graphics on the given topic and thus, to be able to have a visual presentation of the topic, if necessary.

However, it is paid and we as students cannot use its full capacity. It can improve the work of students and teachers in emergency cases providing lessons and even transmitted them in an understandable way. After that, we have to learn, well, we just have to rely on it. Both students and teachers still have ways to improve, but they would definitely improve the learning process by showing steps and even solutions to tasks that even the teachers don't know and by interesting way keeping learners' attention and possibly improving their success.

The positive sides are: saving time for solving assigned questions and tasks; generating interesting and non-standard answers; facilitating both teachers and students in terms of the learning process The negative sides are: excessive use of this type of software stunts the students' capacity and does not stimulate them to use their mental abilities, the option of getting ready-made solutions and opinions will affect the productivity and motivation of the students.  In conclusion, I will say that integrating artificial intelligence into the learning process will be useful from a teaching point of view, but in my opinion, students should not be given complete freedom to complete their practical tasks entirely with this artificial intelligence."

What I can say as a student is that most colleagues use it to avoid wasting their efforts on coursework or assigned homework or to copy tests. It certainly has benefits and saves time when looking for information, but its use should not be a trend. It may take some time for the benefits of generative artificial intelligence to be established and integrated into learning.
